Testing:
Before game server was complete, I used the chatserver program provided by class and set its port to our proxy, 3469. I manually typed possible game server messages, adding field agents and code drops and displaying them on the map.

test1: game server test
test2: chatserver test
test3: game server test with -log=raw

memorytest1: game server test with valgrind
memorytest2: chatserver test with valgrind

Assumptions:
There are less than 10 field agents.
There are less than 50 code drops.
Memory leaks because of GTK are ignored.
There is a responding server.
X11 window is available on the user's part.
